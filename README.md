# 🧠 67 Projects

i ain’t got no sleep fr, bet — makin’ a **brainrot motion thing** you never seen before.  
bro really turned **his random urges and movements** into **memes that move with him** 💀  
where this even came from? idek man, it’s 67 — just pure chaos energy turned into code.

## 💡 what even *is* 67?

“67” ain’t a number, it’s a *state of mind.*  
it’s that moment when u move weird and the universe says:  
> “yo that’s a meme now.”  

every gesture, every move, every half-smirk —  
gets matched with a meme that pops up *as long as you keep doin’ it.*  
stop moving? meme gone.  
start again? the brainrot continues.

## ⚙️ how it works (kinda)

- detects ur **hands, face, upper body** — basically ur goofy motion.  
- matches it with a meme template.  
- spawns the meme **live** while you move.  
- when u stop? it vanishes.  
simple. cursed. legendary.

## 🧩 tech vibe

- motion detection (OpenCV + Mediapipe or smth)  
- meme logic
