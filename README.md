# 67-Projects
i ain’t got no sleep fr, bet — makin’ a brainrot motion thing you never seen before.
bro really turned his random urges and movements into memes that move with him 💀
where this even came from? idek man, it’s 67 — just pure chaos energy turned into code.

basically:

your gesture = meme
stop moving = meme gone
start moving again = brainrot reborn
